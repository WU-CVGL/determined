**New Features**

-  WebUI: The Tasks page has a "Generic Tasks" tab that lists generic tasks with their owner, state,
   slots, resource pool, whether they are pausable, their parent and their start and end times. It
   shows your tasks by default, or the tasks of all users, and can be filtered by state. The Tasks
   tab of a workspace has the same list for the workspace's generic tasks, showing the tasks of all
   users by default like the workspace's other tasks.

-  WebUI: A generic task has a detail page with its name, ID, state, owner, description, parent,
   child tasks and the task it was forked from, its allocations with their slots, exit reasons and
   status codes, its config and its logs. The page can pause, unpause and kill the task, or kill its
   whole tree from the root, after a confirmation, and shows the master's reason when the master
   refuses an action. After an unpause fails, it offers to retry the unpause on the same task, also
   once the task is active again, so that the master can resume the rest of its tree.

-  WebUI: Each row of the generic task lists has an action menu, from its actions button or a right
   click, in the order of the other task menus: **View Logs**, **View Resources** (when task
   resources are enabled), **Copy Task ID**, **Pause** or **Unpause**, and **Kill** in red. Pause,
   unpause and kill are offered to the task's owner or an admin when the task's state allows them,
   as on the detail page, and ask the detail page's confirmations; **Kill** kills the task and its
   descendants.

**Improvements**

-  WebUI: Generic tasks in the job queue are shown under their name with a task icon instead of as
   "Experiment" with part of their ID, link to their detail page and offer "View Logs" and "Kill" in
   their action menu.
